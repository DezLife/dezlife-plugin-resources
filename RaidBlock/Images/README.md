# Plugin Resources (RaidBlock)

This repository stores images used by the **RaidBlock** plugin.  
The plugin automatically attempts to download them from GitHub and then caches them on the server.

If automatic downloading fails for any reason, you can upload the files manually.

## 📂 Where images must be placed on the server

Place the PNG files at the following path:
### **Oxide (uMod)**
oxide/data/RaidBlock/Images/

### **Carbon**
carbon/data/RaidBlock/Images/
